h1. This is a guide to using Kerberos through the JAAS (Java Auth..etc) API

  h2. Prerequisites

    h3. Kerberos server and client tools

    h3. JDK

    h3. make

h1. Setup Kerberos Server Infrastructure

  h2. Choose realm name

  h2. Edit /etc/krb5.conf

  h2. Choose principals

  h2. Add principals using kadmin.local 

h1. Test Kerberos Server Infrastructure

  h2. test with kinit.

h1. Compile Java example code

Run 'make compile'

h1. Runtime configuration of Java example code

 h2. Generate keytab for service principal

 h2. Edit jaas.conf: set KerberizedServer.principal

 h2. Edit server.properties: (FIXME: use keytabs rather than password in file).

 h2. Edit client.properties: (FIXME: prompt for password when client starts rather than password in file).

h1. Test

Run 'make test' will start up the example server and run the client
against it. You may run the client against the same server afterwards
by doing 'make test_client'. You can kill an existing server process
by doing 'make killserver'.
